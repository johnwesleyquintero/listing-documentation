# VA Pay Schedule & Process Explained

This document outlines the weekly payment process and schedule. Understanding this logic is key to knowing when to expect payments and when it is appropriate to follow up.

The entire system is built on a **one-week lag** schedule. This means the payment for the work you complete in one week is processed and sent during the *following* week.

## Key Terminology

*   `Work Week`: The period when you perform and track your work. This runs from **Thursday to Wednesday (PST)**.
*   `Pay Period`: The week *after* the `Work Week`, during which the agency processes and sends your payment. This also runs from **Thursday to Wednesday (PST)**.
*   `Payday Deadline`: The latest you should expect your payment to arrive. This is **Wednesday by end of day (PST)**, which corresponds to **Thursday at 2:59 PM (PHT)**.

## The Weekly Payment Cycle

The process follows a clear, logical flow every week.

1.  **Work is Completed:** You finish your `Work Week` on Wednesday (PST).

2.  **Pay Period Begins:** The following Thursday (PST), the `Pay Period` begins. The agency uses this week to handle the financial logistics.

3.  **Client Pays the Agency:** The client sends the payment (in USD) for the team's work during the completed `Work Week`.

4.  **Bank Clearing (The Waiting Step):** This is the most critical internal step. The agency must wait for the client's payment to clear and become available in their bank account. This can take several business days.

5.  **Agency Processes Payment:** As soon as the funds clear, the agency:
    *   Determines the final amount based on the current USD to PHP exchange rate.
    *   Processes and sends the payment to all VAs.

6.  **Payment is Received:** You receive your payment on or before the `Payday Deadline`.

7.  **Updates on Delays:** If there are any unexpected delays (e.g., bank holidays, slower-than-usual clearing), the agency will post updates on the **VAX Channel** in Slack.

## Example Timeline

Here is a practical example based on the initial query:

| Event | Date Range (PST) | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Work Week** | **July 27 - Aug 2** | You performed the work during this time. |
| **Pay Period** | **Aug 7 - Aug 13** | The agency processes the payment for the July 27-Aug 2 work. |
| **Payday Deadline**| **Wednesday, Aug 13** | This is the target date for the agency to send the payment. |
| **Follow-up Time**| After 2:59 PM Thursday PHT | Only follow up if the payment has not arrived by this time. |

> ### **When to Follow Up**
>
> Per the official instructions, you should only follow up if you have not received your payment by the `Payday Deadline`, which is **Wednesday EOD (PST) / Thursday 2:59 PM (PHT)**.
