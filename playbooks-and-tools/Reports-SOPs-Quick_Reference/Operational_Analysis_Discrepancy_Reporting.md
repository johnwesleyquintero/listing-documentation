# Operational Analysis & Discrepancy Reporting for Product Listings

This document outlines the standardized process for conducting operational analysis and reporting discrepancies found in product listings, particularly on Amazon. Consistent application of this process ensures data accuracy, identifies issues proactively, and facilitates timely resolution.

## 1. Purpose

*   To systematically identify and document inconsistencies between internal product/service data and live marketplace listings.
*   To provide a clear framework for analyzing the operational impact of these discrepancies.
*   To establish a standardized method for reporting issues and tracking their resolution.
*   To ensure all team members understand their role in maintaining listing accuracy and integrity.

## 2. Scope

This process applies to all product listings across all marketplaces (e.g., Amazon, Walmart, eBay) for both SecuLife and SpeedTalk Mobile brands.

## 3. Process Steps

### 3.1. Regular Listing Audit

*   **Frequency:** Conduct audits [e.g., weekly, bi-weekly, monthly] or as triggered by significant product/service updates.
*   **Tools:** Utilize marketplace seller central dashboards, internal product databases, and the documented Amazon Listing Template.
*   **Focus Areas:**
    *   Product Name, ASIN, Model #
    *   Pricing (device and subscription plans)
    *   Bullet Points
    *   A+ Content (text, images, modules)
    *   Backend data (search terms, item type keywords, special features)
    *   Customer reviews and Q&A for potential misinformation.

### 3.2. Discrepancy Identification

*   Compare live listing data against the official product specifications, internal documentation, and marketing briefs.
*   Look for:
    *   **Factual Errors:** Incorrect pricing, data limits, features, compatibility.
    *   **Inconsistencies:** Differences between title, bullets, A+ content, or images.
    *   **Outdated Information:** Promotions or features that are no longer valid.
    *   **Compliance Issues:** Violations of marketplace terms of service (e.g., off-platform links).

### 3.3. Documentation of Discrepancies

For each identified discrepancy, use the "Operational Analysis & Discrepancy Report" section within the relevant product's Amazon Listing Template (or a similar template for other marketplaces) to document the following:

*   **Data Captured On:** Date of the audit.
*   **Live URL:** Direct link to the problematic listing.
*   **Assigned Plan (for STK):** Confirm the exact service plan associated with the listing.
*   **Discrepancy Summary:** Clearly and concisely describe the inconsistency. Be specific (e.g., "Live listing bullet point #3 states 'Unlimited Data' but A+ content shows '4GB Data Cap'").
*   **Operational Impact:** Briefly explain the potential negative consequences (e.g., customer confusion, increased support tickets, negative reviews, compliance risk, lost sales).

### 3.4. Action Plan & Directives

*   **Proposed Solution:** Outline the steps required to correct the discrepancy.
*   **Assigned To:** Assign responsibility for resolution (e.g., Marketing, Operations, Product Team).
*   **Status:** Track the status of the resolution (e.g., "Pending Review," "In Progress," "Resolved").
*   **Date Resolved:** Record the date when the discrepancy was fully corrected on the marketplace.

## 4. Reporting and Communication

*   **Regular Updates:** Share a summary of identified discrepancies and their resolution status during [e.g., weekly operations meetings, daily stand-ups].
*   **Escalation:** Critical discrepancies (e.g., compliance violations, significant financial impact) should be escalated immediately to [relevant stakeholders/management].
*   **Knowledge Sharing:** Use resolved discrepancies as learning opportunities to update internal processes or documentation to prevent recurrence.

## 5. Best Practices

*   **Screenshots:** Capture screenshots of discrepancies for clear documentation.
*   **Version Control:** Ensure that any changes to internal product data or marketing copy are version-controlled and communicated to all relevant teams.
*   **Proactive Monitoring:** Implement alerts or automated checks where possible to flag potential discrepancies early.
