## 1. General Content Principles

*   **Prioritize Tweaks Over Replacements:** Only modify content that is broken, outdated, or explicitly requires an update. Avoid arbitrary changes to existing bullets or descriptions.
*   **Strategic Additions:** When updating, add new relevant information rather than completely overwriting approved content, unless instructed otherwise.

## 2. Specific Content Exclusions & Updates

*   **Mobile App References (STRICT):**
    *   **NEVER** mention a "mobile app" for SpeedTalk Mobile.
    *   Any existing references to a mobile app must be removed immediately.
    *   Always direct users to the **website/online support** for account management, activation, and assistance.
*   **GSM Terminology (Obsolete):**
    *   Remove all mentions of "GSM" in listings and bullet points.
    *   Ensure all connectivity references are updated to reflect current technologies: **4G/5G/LTE**.

## 3. Listing Bullet Point Structure (Avi's Approved Layout)

*   **Strict Adherence:** Follow Avi's recommended 5-point bullet structure for product listings.
*   **Bullet 1 (Listing Position):** The *first* bullet on the listing should be our essential introductory information (e.g., "Compatible with SpeedTalk Mobile...").
*   **Bullet 2 (Listing Position):** Avi's recommended "Broad device coverage" bullet must be placed as the *second* bullet on the listing.
    *   *Avi's Wording Example:* "Our 4G LTE/5G SIM cards are designed for use in a wide range of devices including smartphones, IoT devices, mobile hotspots, security cameras, solar-powered monitoring systems, and more, ensuring versatile connectivity."
*   **Bullet 3 (Listing Position):** Avi's recommended "3-in-1 SIM card sizes and device adaptability."
    *   *Avi's Wording Example:* "Experience seamless compatibility with our 3-in-1 SIM card, pre-cut to Standard, Micro, and Nano sizes, making it perfect for smartphones, smartwatches, GPS trackers, and a variety of other devices."
*   **Bullet 4 (Listing Position):** Avi's recommended "Nationwide coverage."
    *   *Avi's Wording Example:* "Enjoy reliable nationwide coverage from coast-to-coast on our robust 5G/4G LTE network, ensuring your devices stay connected wherever you go."
*   **Bullet 5 (Listing Position):** Avi's recommended "Easy activation and prepaid plans."
    *   *Avi's Wording Example:* "Activate with ease and choose from our flexible prepaid plans—no contracts, no hidden fees, and the freedom to cancel anytime. Manage your account effortlessly via our dedicated website."

## 4. SEO & Keyword Strategy

*   **Leverage Avi's Structure:** Utilize the simplified and structured bullet points provided by Avi for inherent search visibility.
*   **Image Meta Tags:** Add relevant keywords as meta tags (alt text) to all images (A+ Content, main images, etc.) for enhanced indexing and SEO. Adhere strictly to the **100-character limit** for alt text.
*   **Backend Keywords:** Populate backend search terms with generic, high-impact keywords, avoiding commas and repetition, adhering to Amazon's character limits (typically 250 characters).

---

## 5. Product-Specific Usage & Keyword Alignment

*   **Understand Product Functionality:** Always read and understand the product's intended use before making any SEO or listing improvements.
*   **GPS Tracker SIM Specificity (CRITICAL):**
    *   For listings explicitly for **GPS Tracker SIM cards**, the product is ONLY for:
        *   GPS trackers
        *   Pet trackers
        *   Car trackers
        *   Motorcycle trackers
        *   Vehicle trackers
        *   Any other device whose *primary function* is tracking and requires a SIM card.
    *   **EXCLUSION:** These specific GPS Tracker SIMs are **NOT** for MiFi routers, general hotspots, or devices primarily focused on providing general Wi-Fi/internet access. Ensure backend keywords and copy reflect this distinction.
