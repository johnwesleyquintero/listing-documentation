- **Secondary Anchor:** “SOS + GPS + Connection” (core SecuLife DNA).  
- **Design Direction:**  
  - S8 = circular, pendant visuals (caregiver + senior)  
  - S16 = wrist-mounted display (health-oriented)  
  - S17 = minimalist band (comfort and simplicity)  
- **Copy Sync Guideline:**  
  Each listing should reflect its **unique feature set** but **share emotional language** (“care,” “connection,” “independence”).
