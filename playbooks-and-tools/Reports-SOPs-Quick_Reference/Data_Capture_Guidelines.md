# Data Capture Guidelines for Product Listings

These guidelines ensure accurate, consistent, and comprehensive data capture for all product listings, particularly for Amazon. Adhering to these guidelines is crucial for maintaining data integrity, facilitating efficient operations, and providing clear information to customers.

## 1. General Principles

*   **Accuracy:** All data entered must be factually correct and verified against official product specifications or source documents.
*   **Consistency:** Use standardized terminology, formatting, and units across all listings for similar data points.
*   **Completeness:** Ensure all relevant fields in the Amazon Listing Template are populated. If a field is not applicable, explicitly state 'N/A' or 'Not Applicable' rather than leaving it blank.
*   **Timeliness:** Capture and update data promptly as product information, pricing, or operational details change.

## 2. Populating the Amazon Listing Template

Refer to the [Amazon Listing Template](../../playbooks-and-tools/templates/Amazon_Listing_Template.md) for the structured format. Below are specific guidelines for key sections:

### 2.1. Core Product Information

*   **Product Name:** Use the official product name. Ensure it matches the title on Amazon exactly.
*   **ASIN:** Always verify the ASIN directly from the Amazon product page.
*   **Item Model #:** Use the internal model number or manufacturer's model number.
*   **Amazon Link:** Copy the direct link from the Amazon product page.

### 2.2. Pricing Structure

*   **Device Price:** Record the current selling price of the device on Amazon.
*   **Subscription Plans:** Clearly list all available subscription plans, including price and billing period. Verify these against the official service plan documentation.

### 2.3. Listing Bullet Points

*   Copy and paste the bullet points directly from the live Amazon listing. Note any discrepancies if the live bullets differ from the intended or approved marketing copy.

### 2.4. A+ Content Breakdown

*   **Overview:** Provide a concise summary of the A+ content's purpose and main selling points.
*   **Key Modules/Sections:** Describe each significant module or section within the A+ content, detailing its purpose and the information it conveys. Include screenshots or references to the A+ content files if available.

### 2.5. Operational Analysis & Discrepancy Report

*   **Data Captured On:** Always record the date when the data was last verified or captured from Amazon.
*   **Live URL:** Re-confirm the Amazon product URL.
*   **Assigned Plan:** For SpeedTalk Mobile, specify the exact service plan associated with the listing (e.g., "$15 Unlimited Talk/Text/4GB Data").
*   **Discrepancy Summary:** This is critical. Document *any* inconsistencies found between the Amazon listing (title, bullets, A+ content, price) and internal product/service specifications. Be specific about what contradicts what.
*   **Action Plan & Directives:** Outline clear, actionable steps to resolve identified discrepancies. Assign responsibility if known.

### 2.6. Backend Data & Notes

*   **Backend Search Terms:** List all search terms used in the Amazon backend. This is vital for SEO and discoverability.
*   **Item Type Keyword:** Record the specific item type keyword selected in Amazon Seller Central.
*   **Target Audience:** Define the primary target demographic for the product.
*   **Special Features (Backend):** Document any special features or attributes selected in the backend that are not visible on the frontend.
*   **Additional Notes:** Use this section for any other pertinent information, historical context, or future considerations related to the listing.

## 3. Verification and Review Process

*   **Cross-referencing:** Always cross-reference data points with multiple sources (e.g., Amazon Seller Central, internal product sheets, marketing briefs).
*   **Regular Audits:** Conduct periodic reviews of live listings against documented data to catch any unauthorized changes or new discrepancies.
*   **Feedback Loop:** Establish a clear process for reporting and resolving data inconsistencies or errors.
