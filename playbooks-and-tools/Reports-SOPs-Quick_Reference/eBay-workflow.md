### **Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): eBay Account Management for STK**

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Date:** August 20, 2025
**Channel Manager:** John Wesley Quintero

**1. Core Objective:**
To manage the STK eBay sales channel to maximize sales, maintain impeccable account health, and ensure a world-class customer experience, while operating in a secure and efficient manner.

**2. Guiding Principles:**
*   **Protect the Account First:** Every action must be weighed against its potential impact on our account health and seller metrics. We will never take a risk that could lead to a defect or suspension.
*   **Systematize Everything:** We do not rely on memory or guesswork. All recurring tasks are part of a documented, repeatable system to ensure consistency and quality.
*   **Communicate with Precision:** All communications with management regarding issues, proposals, or blocked tasks will be clear, concise, and documented (via WhatsApp/Email) to create a permanent record.

### **3. Operational Cadence: Daily Tasks (The Morning Audit)**

*This checklist must be completed every single day to maintain operational control.*

**A. Order Fulfillment Queue**
*   **Task:** Check for any new or overdue FBM orders awaiting shipment.
*   **Why it's critical:** This is the most time-sensitive task. Failing to ship on time is the fastest way to get a defect and damage our account health.
*   **Action:** Initiate the "FBM Order Fulfillment Workflow" (see Section 4).
*   **Direct Link:** **[Orders Awaiting Shipment](https://www.ebay.com/sh/ord/?filter=status:AWAITING_SHIPMENT)**

**B. Customer Messages & Inquiries**
*   **Task:** Review and respond to all incoming buyer messages.
*   **Why it's critical:** Fast response times improve customer satisfaction and are a key part of eBay's seller metrics.
*   **Action:** Provide professional, helpful responses. Clear the inbox to zero daily.

**C. Cases, Returns, and Disputes**
*   **Task:** Check for any new or pending return requests, "Item Not Received" cases, or payment disputes.
*   **Why it's critical:** These are time-sensitive and require immediate action. Ignoring them leads to automatic defects and financial loss.
*   **Action:** Address every case according to our return policy.

**D. Account Health Dashboard Review**
*   **Task:** Proactively review the main Account Health dashboard.
*   **Why it's critical:** This is our early-warning system. It allows us to see new defects, policy violations, or negative feedback before they become a major problem.
*   **Action:** Identify and investigate any new issues. Escalate if necessary (see Section 8).

**E. FBM Inventory Reset**
*   **Task:** Execute the "Low-Stock Alert & Reset" protocol.
*   **Why it's critical:** Fulfills the primary directive to ensure our products are always available for sale, preventing lost sales and maintaining listing momentum.
*   **Action:** Using our `STK_Data_Dump` Google Sheet, identify any SKUs below the approved threshold and reset their quantity on eBay to the approved default number.

### **4. Core Workflow: FBM Order Fulfillment**

*This is the precise, multi-step process for handling new FBM orders.*

1.  **Identify Orders:** In the [Awaiting Shipment](https://www.ebay.com/sh/ord/?filter=status:AWAITING_SHIPMENT) queue, identify all new orders.
2.  **Create Pick List:** Consolidate the necessary information (Order #, SKU, Qty, Customer Name/Address) into a clear "Pick List."
3.  **Transmit to Warehouse:** Send the Pick List to the designated warehouse contact/channel.
4.  **Await Confirmation:** Wait for the warehouse to confirm they have picked, packed, and **weighed** the items.
5.  **Receive Weights:** The warehouse will send the final weight and dimensions for each order back to you.
6.  **Purchase Labels:** Go into eBay, use the "Purchase Shipping Label" function, and input the correct weights/dimensions to buy the labels.
7.  **Transmit Labels:** Send the generated PDF shipping labels back to the warehouse contact.
8.  **Final Confirmation:** Once the warehouse confirms the labels are applied and the packages are with the carrier, double-check that the tracking numbers have been automatically uploaded to eBay and the orders have moved from "Awaiting Shipment" to "Shipped."

### **5. Key Areas for Attention & Strategic Suggestions**

*This section contains eBay-specific knowledge critical for success.*

*   **Seller Levels (The Goal):** Our objective is to achieve and maintain **"Top Rated Seller"** status. This provides a fee discount and a "Top Rated Plus" badge on our listings, which increases customer trust and sales. This requires low defect rates, low late shipment rates, and timely case resolution.
*   **Item Specifics (Critical for Search):** This is eBay's version of Amazon's attributes, but it is **far more important.** A listing with incomplete Item Specifics is nearly invisible in eBay's filtered search. When creating or auditing listings, our goal should be 100% completion of all relevant Item Specifics.
*   **Promoted Listings (The Accelerator):** eBay's advertising system is called "Promoted Listings." It allows us to pay a percentage of the final sale price to get our listings preferential placement in search results. This is a key tool for driving traffic to new or important products.
*   **Feedback Management:** Negative feedback is highly damaging. We must monitor feedback daily and, when a negative is received, professionally and publicly respond to it to show other buyers that we are responsive and responsible.

### **6. Escalation Protocol**

*You are the operator, not the final decision-maker. Escalate when necessary.*

*   **When to Escalate:**
    *   Any official Policy Violation warning from eBay.
    *   Any financial question or dispute you are unsure about.
    *   Any request from a customer that falls outside our standard policies.
    *   Any situation where you do not have a clear, pre-approved protocol.
*   **Who to Escalate To:**
    *   **Primary Contact (Operations):** Xavi. For all day-to-day operational questions, process clarifications, and issues.
    *   **Secondary Contact (Final Approval):** Avi. For larger strategic decisions, pricing approvals, and issues that Xavi cannot resolve.
