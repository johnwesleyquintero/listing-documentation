**4. FBM Inventory Management (Critical Task)**
*   **The Mission:** As per Xavi's directive, our primary inventory task is to **prevent stockouts** for our Fulfilled by Merchant (FBM) listings.
*   **Action:** Scan the "Quantity" column on the Active Listings page. Identify any SKUs with low stock levels. Your task is to **"refill" the inventory by updating the available quantity** to ensure we remain in stock and ready to sell.
