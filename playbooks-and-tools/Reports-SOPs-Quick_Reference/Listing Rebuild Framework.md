## ⚙️ I. DATA INPUTS (FOUNDATIONAL LAYER)

### 📊 1. Search Query Performance (SQP)
**Source:** Brand Analytics – Week 40, 2025  
**Top Relevant Queries:**
| Search Query | Volume | CTR | Notes |
|---------------|---------|------|------|
| speedtalk sim card | 109 | 43.12% | High brand recognition but low share |
| prepaid cellphone card | 4 | 50% | Niche but high intent |
| sim card talk and text | 10 | 60% | Excellent conversion potential |
| unlimited data sim card | 605 | 34% | Competes in high-volume prepaid category |
| sim card for samsung | 32 | 18.7% | Android compatibility opportunity |
| chip con internet pagado | 9 | 100% | Spanish-language searches — localization opportunity |

**Insight:**  
SpeedTalk ranks in high-search English + Spanish queries but loses visibility to competitors due to incomplete keyword targeting and unclear compatibility messaging.

### 💬 2. Voice of the Customer (VOC) & Reviews
**CX Health:** “Very Poor”  
**Top Issues Identified:**
1. **Activation Friction** (Zip code, credit card, setup delays)  
2. **Auto-renew confusion** (“Prepaid” perceived as subscription)  
3. **Coverage performance** complaints in specific states  
4. **Device compatibility** unclear for watches/2G/3G phones  
5. **Spam calls/texts** perception lowering trust

**Opportunity:**  
- Add visual “Activation Guide” in A+  
- Clarify billing model in title/bullet  
- Use FAQ to handle “Does it work with my phone/watch?”  
- Strengthen trust & network messaging (coverage map)

### 🧩 3. Competitor Benchmark
**Top 10 Non-Brand ASINs Used in Helium10 Cerebro:**
```

B0C6BMYG7J, B09L4JRTVZ, B09KW4SWZ8, B0BZ76SYLP, B0B8FF6M2J, B0CQ2M6Q96, B0D4T8G6Z5, B0C7KQXT47, B0C91B2MHT, B0CJ5FWB7R

```
**Patterns Found:**  
- All lead with *“Unlimited”*, *“No Contract”*, and *“Nationwide”* claims.  
- Most use “3-in-1 SIM” in first 60 characters of title.  
- Visual emphasis: plan tiers + coverage map + “Works with iPhone/Android.”  
- No one explains *activation transparency* well — this is our edge.
