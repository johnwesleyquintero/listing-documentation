# **Listing Optimization Framework v1.1**

### *(SpeedTalk Mobile / SecuLife Master Template)*

---

## **I. DATA INPUTS**

Our framework draws from three foundational data sources:

1. **Search Query Performance (SQP):** Amazon Brand Analytics keywords, click share, and conversion insights.
2. **Voice of the Customer (VOC):** Returns, NCX (Not as Expected), feedback, and review trends.
3. **Competitor Benchmark (Helium10 / Market Analysis):** Top 10 non-brand ASINs for keyword validation, pricing, and creative tone.

## **II. VOC → ACTION MATRIX**

This matrix operationalizes customer pain points into A+ content solutions.

| Defective SIM or non-working | Isolated activation/defect issues                       | Support Module       | Add “Replacement Guarantee” section: “If your SIM fails to activate, we’ll replace it free.”                    |
| Spam calls/texts             | Perception of low network quality                       | Trust/Support Module | Add “Clean Numbers Policy – we protect your number from spam.”                                                  |
