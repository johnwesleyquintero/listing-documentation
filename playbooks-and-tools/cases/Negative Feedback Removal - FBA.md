## 🧠 SOP: Negative Feedback Removal (FBA – Delivery / Not Received)

**Applies to:**
All brands (SecuLife, SpeedTalk, EMK, Jolt)
**Condition:** Order is **Fulfilled by Amazon (FBA)** and feedback references delivery, delay, or non-receipt only.

---

### 🟦 STEP 1 — Mandatory First Attempt (Feedback Manager)

1. Go to **Performance → Feedback Manager**
2. Locate the feedback
3. Click **Request removal**
4. Select reason closest to:

   * *“Feedback is about fulfillment/delivery handled by Amazon”*
5. Submit and wait for decision

📌 **Note:** Even if denied, this step is required for escalation.

---

### 🟨 STEP 2 — Case Reopen + Live Chat (Critical Step)

If denied:

1. Open **Case Log**
2. Re-open the feedback case
3. Start **Live Chat** (preferred over email)
4. Attach screenshot of:

   * Feedback text
   * Order showing **FBA**
5. Use the escalation script below ⬇️

---

### 🗣️ LIVE CHAT ESCALATION SCRIPT (COPY–PASTE)

> This order was fulfilled by Amazon (FBA).
>
> The customer feedback only states that the package was not received, which is entirely related to Amazon fulfillment and delivery and is outside of seller control.
>
> Per Amazon’s feedback removal guidelines, feedback that is solely about fulfillment or delivery for FBA orders is eligible for removal.
>
> This request was already submitted via Feedback Manager and denied. We are requesting a second review and escalation, as the responsibility lies with Amazon, not the seller.

⛔ **Do NOT say:**

* “Violation”
* “Unfair”
* “Please as a courtesy”

✅ **Always say:**

* *Outside seller control*
* *Fulfilled by Amazon*
* *Second review*

---

### 🟧 STEP 3 — WAIT FOR THE MAGIC SENTENCE

Once the rep says:

> “I am reaching out to the relevant team for a second review”

🛑 **STOP PUSHING**
This means escalation is in motion.

---

### 🟩 STEP 4 — Confirmation & Verification

1. Wait for email confirmation
2. Verify in **Feedback Manager**
3. Screenshot confirmation
4. Log task as **Completed – Feedback Suppressed**

---

## 🏆 GOLD-STANDARD CONFIRMATION LANGUAGE (REFERENCE)

> “The feedback received for the order has been suppressed as it was fulfilled by Amazon.”

If you see this exact phrasing → **win condition met**.

---

## 📌 INTERNAL OPERATOR NOTE (Save This)

* Average attempts needed: **2–3**
* Different reps = different outcomes
* Persistence + policy framing beats emotion
* Live Chat > Email
* Script compliance > arguing correctness

---

## 🧠 FINAL WORD

Most sellers quit after the first “not eligible.”
You didn’t. You **outlasted the system** until it behaved correctly.

This SOP is now **battle-tested**.
Next time, this will take you **10 minutes instead of 3 cases**.

* Add this to your **GitHub VA KB**, or
* Convert it into a **one-click Notion / Slack SOP card** 😈
