### Seculife Voice of the Customer (VOC) Status Report

Overall, the account has several listings that require immediate attention to prevent potential account issues or listing suspensions. We have identified two high-priority tiers: **Urgent Action Required (Poor/Very Poor)** and **At-Risk Listings (Fair)**.

---

### ðŸ”´ **Urgent Action Required (Poor & Very Poor Health)**

These listings have a high rate of negative customer experiences (NCX) and are at the greatest risk. We need to investigate the root cause for each one immediately.

*   **ASIN `B0BGJHL6V3` (Very Poor):**
    *   **Problem:** The primary complaint is **"Performance or quality not adequate"** (55% of NCX).
    *   **Status:** This is our most critical issue. A "Very Poor" rating can lead to listing suppression.

*   **ASIN `B0F5YS19J3` (Poor):**
    *   **Problem:** The main issue is **"Performance or quality not adequate"** (66% of NCX).
    *   **Status:** High NCX rate indicates a significant gap between customer expectations and product performance.

*   **ASIN `B0BFZQKB2V` (Poor):**
    *   **Problem:** The top reason for complaints is **"Defective item"** (50% of NCX). The "Return Badge" is also active, which can harm conversion rates.
    *   **Status:** A high "defective" rate suggests a potential quality control issue with this product.

*   **ASIN `B0D2RZVND3` (Poor):**
    *   **Problem:** The key issue is **"Inaccurate website description"** (40% of NCX). This also has a very high return rate of 24.13%.
    *   **Status:** This is the most actionable issue. We can directly fix this by auditing and improving the product detail page to set clearer expectations.

### ðŸŸ¡ **At-Risk Listings (Fair Health)**

These listings are showing signs of trouble and could be downgraded to "Poor" if not addressed.

*   **ASIN `B0DLHSLHGX` (Fair):**
    *   **Problem:** The primary complaint is **"Defective item"** (50% of NCX), and it has a high return rate.
    *   **Status:** This is a priority to investigate to prevent it from becoming "Poor."

*   **ASIN `B0BG12R3Y3` (Fair):**
    *   **Problem:** The main issue is **"Defective item"** (66% of NCX).
    *   **Status:** Similar to the other "Fair" listing, this points towards a potential quality issue that needs to be reviewed.

### âœ… **Good & Excellent Health**

The majority of the other listings are rated as "Good" or "Excellent." Several of these have an "At risk" or "Yes" return badge, indicating high return rates despite a low NCX rate. We should continue to monitor these, but the focus should remain on the "Poor" and "Fair" listings.

### **Next Steps Recommendation:**

1.  **Prioritize the "Poor" ASINs,** starting with `B0D2RZVND3` ("Inaccurate website description") as it is the easiest to fix through content updates.
2.  **Investigate the "Defective" and "Performance" complaints** for the other ASINs to determine if there is a quality control issue with a specific batch of products.
