### **STK - Voice of the Customer (VOC) Status Report**

The overall VOC health for the STK brand is critical. There is an overwhelming and consistent pattern of products being reported as **"Defective item."** This is the root cause of nearly all listings with a "Poor" or "Very Poor" health rating and must be our top priority.

### **Strategic Conclusion & Next Steps**

The data points to a single, critical business problem: **Customers perceive the SIM cards as defective.** This could be due to several reasons:

1.  **Activation Issues:** The customer cannot activate the card easily and assumes it's broken.
2.  **Compatibility Issues:** The customer is using the card in an incompatible device (e.g., a locked phone).
3.  **Instructional Issues:** The included instructions are unclear, leading to user error.
4.  **Actual Defects:** There may be a batch of genuinely faulty SIM cards.

**Recommended Action Plan:**

1.  **Immediate Deep Dive on Top Offenders:** Pull all customer comments, reviews, and return reasons for the top 3 "Poor" ASINs (`B07933LMZW`, `B07C32C7ZT`, `B07GL7CCLG`). We need to understand *exactly* what customers are saying when they claim it's "defective."
2.  **Audit the Listing Content:** Review the product detail pages for these ASINs. Is the activation process crystal clear? Are the compatible devices listed prominently?
3.  **Proactive Customer Service Template:** Create a pre-written message template for customer inquiries about activation issues, guiding them through the process step-by-step to prevent them from assuming the card is defective.
4.  **Report to Management:** This is a systemic issue beyond just listing optimization. The findings should be reported to management to investigate potential quality control or instructional issues.
