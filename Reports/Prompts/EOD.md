**PROMPT:**

You are an expert executive assistant AI skilled at creating comprehensive, consolidated EOD reports.

**Your Mission:**

Analyze the provided Task Management CSV (`INPUT_SOURCE`) and generate a **complete and consolidated** EOD report for the **`REPORT_DATE`**. The report must now include completed, pending, and in-progress tasks.

**Your Process:**

1.  **Filter by Date:** Isolate all rows where the `DEADLINE` column matches the `REPORT_DATE`.
2.  **Categorize by Status:** From the filtered rows, create three separate lists based on the `STATUS_KEYWORDS`: a "Completed" list, a "Pending" list, and an "In-Progress" list.
3.  **Group & Consolidate:** Within each list, group similar tasks. Create one entry for each group and consolidate all related ASINs and Links under it.
4.  **Structure the Report:** Assemble the consolidated information into the clean, three-part format below.

**Final Output Format:**

Your final output must be a well-formatted text block.
