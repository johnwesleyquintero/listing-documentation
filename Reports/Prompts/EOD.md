`--- KNOWLEDGE BANK (The "Why") ---`

*   **Avi's Core Request:** He needs a full, consolidated summary of daily work.
*   **CRITICAL FORMATTING RULE:** The output **MUST** be WhatsApp-friendly. This means:
    1.  Use emojis for main bullets (e.g., `‚û°Ô∏è`), not asterisks.
    2.  Use bold labels for details (e.g., `*Status:*`), not asterisks as bullets.
    3.  Use indentation to show structure.
    4.  Ensure a blank line between each main task for readability.
