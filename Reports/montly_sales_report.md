### **Procedure**

This procedure outlines the steps required to access the Reports Repository and download your desired monthly summary.

1.  **Navigate to Payments**
    *   From the Seller Central homepage, hover over the main menu (the three horizontal lines in the top-left).
    *   Click on **Payments**. This will take you to the "Payments Dashboard" / "Statement View".

2.  **Go to the Reports Repository**
    *   On the Payments page, click on the **Reports Repository** tab. This is where you can generate new reports and download historical ones.

3.  **Configure Your Report**
    *   In the "Generate a report" section at the top of the page, set the following options:
    *   **1. Report Type:** Select **`Summary`** from the dropdown menu.
    *   **2. Reporting Date Range:** Select the **`Month`** radio button, then choose the specific **Month** and **Year** you need from the dropdowns.

4.  **Request the Report**
    *   **3. Click the `Request Report` button.**
    *   The page will refresh, and you will see your requested report appear at the top of the "Payments Reports" table below. Its status will likely show as "Generating...".

5.  **Download the Report**
    *   Wait a few moments for the report to generate. You may need to refresh the page.
    *   **4. Once the "Status" column shows `Ready`** (with a green checkmark), a button will appear in the "Action" column.
    *   **Click the `Download PDF` button.** The report will be downloaded to your computer.

### **Important Notes**

*   **Summary vs. Transaction:** Selecting `Summary` gives you a high-level PDF. If you need a detailed, line-by-line breakdown of every single transaction, choose the `Transaction` report type instead, which will generate a downloadable CSV file.
*   **Generation Time:** Reports can take a few minutes to generate, especially for months with a high volume of transactions.
