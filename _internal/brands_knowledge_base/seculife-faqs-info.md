## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

### Time Display & School Mode

**Q: Is the watch time display digital? Can it show only the time without app icons?**
**A:** Yes, the watch displays time digitally for easy reading. It can be set to show only the time. The School Mode feature also helps limit distractions during class.

### International Calling & Connectivity (Mariam's Case)

**Q: My SecuLife watch is not making calls in Egypt. What should I do?**
**A:** The included SIM card is designed for US partner networks, and standard calls are limited to US-based numbers. However, if the watch is connected to **WiFi**, you can use the **video calling feature within the SecuLife app** to call the watch from your smartphone anywhere in the world. Ensure the phone number you use to call the watch is registered in the SecuLife app for security.

### Military Time Format

**Q: Can I change the watch's time format from military (24-hour) to standard (12-hour)?**
**A:** Currently, SecuLife kids' smartwatches only support the 24-hour (military) format. Future batches may include 12-hour format support, and free exchanges may be offered upon availability. Location-Based Services (LBS) use GPS, Wi-Fi, or cellular data for location tracking and should remain enabled for accuracy. LBS acts as a backup when GPS signals are weak, using cell towers for location estimation (less accurate than GPS).

### Watch Camera & Video Call Capabilities

**Q: Does the watch have camera and video capabilities? Can it make video calls?**
**A:** Yes, the watch can take photos. While it does not support video recording, it is equipped for video calls. You can make video calls through the dedicated app when the watch is connected to a network.
