## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

### Time Display & School Mode

**Q: Is the watch time display digital? Can it show only the time without app icons?**
**A:** Yes, the watch displays time digitally for easy reading. It can be set to show only the time. The School Mode feature also helps limit distractions during class.

### International Calling & Connectivity (Mariam's Case)

**Q: My SecuLife watch is not making calls in Egypt. What should I do?**
**A:** The included SIM card is designed for US partner networks, and standard calls are limited to US-based numbers. However, if the watch is connected to **WiFi**, you can use the **video calling feature within the SecuLife app** to call the watch from your smartphone anywhere in the world. Ensure the phone number you use to call the watch is registered in the SecuLife app for security.

### Military Time Format

**Q: Can I change the watch's time format from military (24-hour) to standard (12-hour)?**
**A:** Currently, SecuLife kids' smartwatches only support the 24-hour (military) format. Future batches may include 12-hour format support, and free exchanges may be offered upon availability. Location-Based Services (LBS) use GPS, Wi-Fi, or cellular data for location tracking and should remain enabled for accuracy. LBS acts as a backup when GPS signals are weak, using cell towers for location estimation (less accurate than GPS).
