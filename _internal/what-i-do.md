*   Systematically tracking and reporting on daily KPIs to provide leadership with a clear view of operational performance.

**3. Complex Operational Problem-Solving:**
*   Executing complex, large-scale catalog operations, such as the SKU-level takedown of 33 ASINs in the Brazil marketplace.
*   Troubleshooting systemic platform issues, including cache persistence, data conflicts, and fulfillment channel errors (FBA vs. FBM).
*   Acting as the primary driver for resolving complex support cases and operational roadblocks.

**4. Strategic Analysis & Reporting:**
*   Analyzing raw Voice of the Customer (VOC) data to distill actionable insights and identify root causes of negative sentiment.
*   Conducting deep-dive competitive analysis on A+ Content and listing strategy to inform our own development.
*   Presenting findings and strategic recommendations to leadership to gain approval for process improvements.

**5. System & Process Development (The Core Function):**
*   Architecting and maintaining robust operational systems, including SKU-level trackers, project-specific checklists, and monitoring dashboards.
*   **Codifying all significant operational actions and analyses into a permanent, searchable knowledge base using GitHub.**
*   Creating and refining repeatable playbooks for complex tasks to ensure long-term efficiency and consistency.
