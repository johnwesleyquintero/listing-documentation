### **Operational Analysis & Discrepancy Report**

**Assigned Plan (Pending Confirmation):** `$15 / 6GB DATA`

**Discrepancy Summary:**

- **Price vs. Title Conflict:** The Buy Box price is **$10.00**, but the title and core plan value are advertised as **$15.00**. This is a known point of customer confusion.
- **Misleading A+ Text:** The phrase "Unlimited Data (first 6GB HIGH SPEED...)" is confusing and contradicts the clearer "6 GB Data" messaging in the title.
- **CRITICAL FAILURE (Comparison Table):** The A+ Content comparison table is factually incorrect.
  - It shows the `$15` plan as having **4GB** of data (INCORRECT).
  - It shows the `$18` plan as having **6GB** of data (INCORRECT).

### **Action Plan & Directives**

**Directive 1 (Xavi):** Move the plan comparison table to the #1 position in the A+ Content.

**Directive 2 (Avi):** Simplify the comparison table design (remove star ratings, etc.).

**Recommended Path (Do It Right Once):**
- **[PAUSE]** Do not move the existing, incorrect table.
- **[EXECUTE]** Combine directives into a single request for a new, corrected, and simplified graphic asset.
- **[AWAITING]** This task is on hold pending receipt of the new graphic.

**Immediate Text Corrections Needed:**
- `[ ]` **Title:** Confirm it aligns with the final plan. (Currently seems correct).
- `[ ]` **Bullet Points:** Review for clarity regarding the $10 purchase vs. $15 plan value.
- `[X]` **A+ Content Text:** **URGENTLY** change "Unlimited Data (first 6GB...)" to "6GB of High-Speed Data" to eliminate confusion.
