### **Operational Analysis & Discrepancy Report**

**Assigned Plan (Pending Confirmation):** `$18 / 9GB DATA`

**Discrepancy Summary:**

- **Price vs. Title Conflict:** The Buy Box price is **$14.40**, but the title and core plan value are advertised as **$18.00**. This creates the same customer confusion as the previous ASIN.
- **Misleading A+ Text:** The phrase "Unlimited Data (first 9GB...)" is again used, which is confusing when the title clearly states "9GB Data". This appears to be a systemic copy-paste issue.
- **CRITICAL FAILURE (Comparison Table):** The A+ Content comparison table is factually incorrect and is the primary source of error for this listing.
  - It shows the `$18` plan as having **6GB** of data (INCORRECT, should be 9GB).

---

### **Action Plan & Directives**

**Directive 1 (Xavi):** Move the plan comparison table to the #1 position in the A+ Content.

**Directive 2 (Avi):** Simplify the comparison table design (remove star ratings, etc.).

**Recommended Path (Do It Right Once):**
- **[PAUSE]** Do not move the existing, incorrect table.
- **[EXECUTE]** Combine directives into a single request for a new, corrected, and simplified graphic asset.
- **[AWAITING]** This task is on hold pending receipt of the new graphic.

**Immediate Text Corrections Needed:**
- `[ ]` **Title:** Confirm it aligns with the final plan. (Currently seems correct).
- `[ ]` **Bullet Points:** Review for clarity regarding the $14.40 purchase vs. $18 plan value.
- `[X]` **A+ Content Text:** **URGENTLY** change "Unlimited Data (first 9GB...)" to "9GB of High-Speed Data" to eliminate confusion.
