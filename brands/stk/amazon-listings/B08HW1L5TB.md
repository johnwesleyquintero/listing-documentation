## 5. Operational Analysis & Discrepancy Report

*   **Data Captured On:** 2025-08-14
*   **Live URL:** https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08HW1L5TB
*   **Assigned Plan (if applicable):** `UNKNOWN. Listing has multiple, severe data conflicts.`
*   **Discrepancy Summary:**
    *   **CRITICAL DATA CONFLICT:** The listing's core offer is completely incoherent across its different components.
        *   **Hero Image & Bullet Points claim:** A **9GB** Data plan.
        *   **The Live Variation Selector on the page offers:** A **6GB** plan and a **2GB** plan. Neither of these match the 9GB advertised in the main content.
        *   **The Backend `item model number` field confirms:** "UNLI CALL & TEXT +6GB DATA", aligning with the variation but contradicting the hero image and bullets.
    *   **Price vs. Value Conflict:** The Buy Box price is **$14.40**, while the bullet points and hero image advertise an **$18** plan value.
    *   **MISSING A+ ASSET:** This listing lacks the specific plan comparison table, making the directives from Xavi and Avi impossible to execute as-is.
*   **Action Plan & Directives:**
    *   **Directive 1 (Xavi):** Move the plan comparison table to the #1 position.
        *   **STATUS: IMPOSSIBLE.** The A+ Content for this ASIN does not contain this specific module.
    *   **Directive 2 (Avi):** Simplify the comparison table design.
        *   **STATUS: IMPOSSIBLE.** The table does not exist.
    *   **Recommended Path (Total Rebuild Required):**
        *   **[FLAG FOR REVIEW]** This ASIN, like others in this cohort, requires a complete rebuild, not a simple correction.
        *   **[CLARIFY INTENT]** The first and most critical step is to get a definitive answer from leadership: **"What plan is B08HW1L5TB *supposed* to be?"** The page is currently a contradictory mix of 9GB, 6GB, and 2GB offers.
        *   **[AWAITING]** All work on this ASIN is on hold until its core identity is defined and the necessary A+ Content and image assets can be created.
