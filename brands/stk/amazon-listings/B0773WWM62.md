## 5. Operational Analysis & Discrepancy Report

*   **Data Captured On:** 2025-08-13
*   **Live URL:** https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0773WWM62
*   **Assigned Plan (if applicable):** `UNKNOWN. Listing is critically conflicted across multiple assets.`
*   **Discrepancy Summary:**
    *   **CRITICAL DATA CONFLICT:** The listing advertises **three different data plans** simultaneously (3GB, 6GB, 4GB) across the title, hero image, and A+ content.
    *   **Price vs. Value Conflict:** The Buy Box price is **$10.00**, but the plan value is referenced as **$15.00**.
    *   **Misleading Language:** The bullet point "Unlimited Data... First 3GB at full speed..." is inherently confusing and contradicts other information.
*   **Action Plan & Directives:**
    *   **Directive 1 (Xavi):** Move the plan comparison table to the #1 position. **STATUS: ON HOLD.** Moving the table would promote factually incorrect information (4GB).
    *   **Directive 2 (Avi):** Simplify the comparison table design. **STATUS: ON HOLD.** The table is one of three conflicting assets. A new design is needed, but only after the correct plan is identified.
    *   **Recommended Path (Total Rebuild Required):**
        *   **[FLAG FOR REVIEW]** This ASIN must be completely rebuilt. It is unsalvageable in its current state.
        *   **[CLARIFY INTENT]** The first and most critical step is to ask Xavi/leadership: "What plan is B0773WWM62 *supposed* to be? The page currently advertises 3GB, 4GB, and 6GB simultaneously."
        *   **[AWAITING]** All work on this ASIN is on hold until its core identity is defined and the necessary hero image and A+ Content are created from scratch.
