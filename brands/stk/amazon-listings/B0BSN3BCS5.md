### **Operational Analysis & Discrepancy Report**

**Assigned Plan (Pending Confirmation):** **UNKNOWN. Listing is severely conflicted.**

**Discrepancy Summary:**

- **MASSIVE DATA CONFLICT:** The listing's core offer is completely incoherent.
  - **Title states:** `4 GB High Speed`
  - **Hero Image displays:** `9 GB Data`
  - **First Bullet Point claims:** `$18`, `Unlimited Data`, and `First 4 GB data` all in the same sentence.
- **Price vs. Value Conflict:** The Buy Box price is **$12.60**, while the bullet point claims a plan value of **$18**.
- **MISSING A+ CONTENT:** This listing lacks any A+ Content, including the comparison table referenced in our directives. This is a major issue impacting conversion and customer understanding.

---

### **Action Plan & Directives**

**Directive 1 (Xavi):** Move the plan comparison table to the #1 position.
*   **STATUS: IMPOSSIBLE.** The A+ Content does not exist on this ASIN.

**Directive 2 (Avi):** Simplify the comparison table design.
*   **STATUS: IMPOSSIBLE.** The table does not exist.

**Recommended Path (Total Rebuild Required):**
- **[FLAG FOR REVIEW]** This ASIN cannot be "corrected." It must be completely rebuilt.
- **[CLARIFY INTENT]** The first and most critical step is to ask Xavi/leadership: **"What plan is B0BSN3BCS5 *supposed* to be?"**
- **[AWAITING]** All work on this ASIN is on hold until its core identity is defined and the necessary A+ Content and image assets are created from scratch.

**Immediate Text Corrections Needed:**
- All text corrections are blocked pending a decision on the ASIN's actual plan.
