# Amazon Listing Documentation Template

This template has been deprecated in favor of the standardized `Amazon_Listing_Template.md` located at `playbooks-and-tools/templates/Amazon_Listing_Template.md`.

## Why This Change?
- Ensures consistency across all product documentation
- Provides a comprehensive structure for operational analysis
- Makes onboarding easier for new team members

## How To Use
1. Copy the standard template from `playbooks-and-tools/templates/Amazon_Listing_Template.md`
2. Save it using the ASIN as the filename (e.g. `B0773WWM62.md`)
3. Fill in all sections completely, especially:
   - Core Product Information
   - Pricing Structure
   - Operational Analysis & Discrepancy Report
