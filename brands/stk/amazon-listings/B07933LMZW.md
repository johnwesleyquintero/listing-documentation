## 5. Operational Analysis & Discrepancy Report

*   **Data Captured On:** 2025-08-14
*   **Live URL:** https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07933LMZW
*   **Assigned Plan (if applicable):** `N/A`
*   **Discrepancy Summary:**
    *   **Current Threat:** Active Account Health Violation for "Product Condition Complaint - Defective" as of 2025-08-14.
    *   **Customer Complaint Summary:** "Item delivered won't hold SIM card."
    *   **Root Cause Analysis:** The primary driver of "defective" complaints is a failure to properly educate the customer on the physical nature of the "3-in-1 Triple-Cut" SIM card. The listing does not prominently feature a visual guide in the main image block explaining that the user must select and "pop out" the correct size (Standard, Micro, or Nano). Customers unfamiliar with this mechanism attempt to insert the wrong size, conclude that it "won't hold," and report the product as defective. The key educational infographic is currently buried in the A+ Content, reducing its effectiveness.
*   **Action Plan & Directives:**
    *   **A) The root cause of the issue:** We have conducted a thorough investigation into the "Product Condition Complaint - Defective" for ASIN B07933LMZW, triggered by a customer summary of "Item delivered won't hold SIM card." Our deep-dive analysis of the product detail page and customer behavior patterns has identified that the root cause is not a product defect, but a failure in on-page customer education. The product is a "3-in-1 Triple-Cut SIM" which requires the user to pop out the correct size (Standard, Micro, or Nano). Our listing failed to make this critical information immediately and visually apparent. The key infographic explaining this feature was buried deep in the A+ Content, rather than being in the main image gallery. This led to user error, with customers attempting to insert the wrong SIM size and logically, but incorrectly, concluding the item was defective.
    *   **B) The actions you have taken to resolve the issue:**
        1.  **Elevated Key Educational Asset:** We have taken the "Triple-Cut SIM" infographic from our A+ Content and have now uploaded it as the **second image in the main product image gallery.** This ensures every customer will visually understand the pop-out mechanism before making a purchase.
        2.  **Complete Listing Copy Overhaul:** We have rewritten the title and key bullet points to be crystal clear. The phrase "3-in-1 (Pop-Out Standard, Micro, or Nano Size)" has been strategically added to proactively manage customer expectations about the physical nature of the card.
        3.  **Backend Keyword Refinement:** We have audited and refined the backend search terms to ensure we are attracting customers who are specifically looking for IoT/Tracker SIMs, further reducing the chance of incorrect purchases by cellphone users unfamiliar with these products.
    *   **C) The steps you have taken to prevent the issue from recurring:**
        1.  **New Listing Launch Protocol:** All future product listings for multi-size or technical products will now be required to include a "How-To" or "Key Feature" infographic in the top three main product images as part of our standard launch checklist.
        2.  **Proactive VOC Monitoring SOP:** As the new operations team, we have implemented a formal weekly deep-dive of the Voice of the Customer dashboard. This system allows us to identify and address customer confusion or potential listing inaccuracies *before* they can escalate to an Account Health violation.

We are confident that these actions and systemic improvements not only resolve the specific complaint for this ASIN but also strengthen our entire operational process to better serve Amazon's customers. Thank you.
