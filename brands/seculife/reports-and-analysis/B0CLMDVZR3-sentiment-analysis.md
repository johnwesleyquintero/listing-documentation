## üîë Key Pain Points from Negative Reviews

### 1. Subscription and Refund Issues
*   Customers reported **harsh cancellation policies**: one user paid in full for a year and after a tragic death received no refund‚Äîonly a cancellation fee was offered. Others stated that continuing the plan might cost nothing, but canceling led to penalties. These policies were seen as **unsympathetic and inflexible**. (Review from June 11, 2025)

### 2. Misrepresentation & Missing Components
*   Claims that the product works in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico were contradicted by support staff saying coverage in Canada was only "for trips.‚Äù (Review from March 23, 2025)
*   Multiple reviewers noted that the watch ships **without a charger**, yet it requires a **specialized charger**, making it difficult to power the device. (Review from March 23, 2025)

### 3. Reliability & Technical Failures
*   Customers consistently described **unstable performance**, including shutting down shortly after activation, inability to pair with apps, repeated double charges, and delayed refund processing (30‚Äì60 days).

*   Many reviewers were frustrated by unhelpful or unresponsive customer service during setup, billing issues, and hardware failures. (Reviews from March 23, 2025; January 16, 2025; June 11, 2025)

### 5. Physical Design Issues

## üó∫Ô∏è Recommendation Strategy for a Relaunched Listing

### A. Policy & Messaging Adjustments
*   **Transparent coverage claims:** Clearly outline supported countries and any limitations.

### B. Supply Package & Instructions

*   Provide clear instructions on activation, subscription setup, app pairing, and troubleshooting.

### C. Technical Reliability Improvements
*   Test extensively to prevent **shutdowns**, connection drops, and pairing issues.
*   Fix **billing system glitches** and refund delays to rebuild trust.

### D. Product Design Enhancements
*   Offer **multiple wristband sizes**, including extra-small for fragile wrists. This can also be an add-on product/service.
*   Use clearer visuals and sizing info in images and bullet points.

### E. Customer Support Improvements
*   Establish a responsive, empathetic support team, with case handling for refunds, technical issues, and onboarding assistance. We should check the workarounds for different situations.
