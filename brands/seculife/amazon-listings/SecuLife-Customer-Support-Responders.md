Subject: Re: Understanding Your SecuLife Guardian SOS Smartwatch Service

Dear [Customer Name],

Thank you for reaching out with your question about the SecuLife Guardian SOS Smartwatch service. I understand that our service model might need some clarification, and I'm happy to help.

The SecuLife Guardian SOS Smartwatch operates on a cellular network (just like a mobile phone) to provide its essential safety features, such as real-time GPS tracking, SOS emergency alerts, and two-way calling. Because it uses cellular service, an active service plan is required for the watch to function.

We strive for complete transparency, which is why we clearly outline all service plan details, pricing, and cancellation policies directly on our Amazon product listing (in the bullet points, product description, and A+ content section). We recommend reviewing these sections for a comprehensive understanding.

Our service plans are designed to provide continuous peace of mind and connectivity for your loved one. If you have any further questions or would like assistance in selecting or understanding your plan, please don't hesitate to ask.

Best regards,

The SecuLife Team
