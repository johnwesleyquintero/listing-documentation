## 5. Operational Analysis & Action Plan

### Critical Analysis & Observations

*   **CRITICAL - Damaging Negative Reviews:** The top-rated review is a 1-star comment detailing a very negative experience with the cancellation policy.

These reviews are extremely damaging to brand trust.
*   **Potential Product Issues:** Some reviews mention the watch not working or being too large for some elderly wrists.

*   **Complex Pricing in Bullets:** The bullet points mention a `$25/month with a 1-year contract`, which may conflict with or confuse the plan details shown in the A+ content.
