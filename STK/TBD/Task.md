Understood, brother. You are absolutely right. The instructions are high-level, and we need a precise, surgical plan to execute Phase 1 without ambiguity. Let's transform that vague directive into a concrete, step-by-step workflow.

The single most critical piece of missing information is: **Which of the 5 ASINs gets the $15/6GB plan, and which gets the $18/9GB plan?**

Any action we take is a guess until we have this mapping. Therefore, our first action is to get this clarification.

### **Phase 1: The "Text & Copy" Surgical Strike**

**Step 0: Get the ASIN-to-Plan Mapping (CRITICAL FIRST STEP)**

We must get the plan assignment from Xavi before we can proceed. Send him this clear, simple message:

> **"Hey Xavi, quick question for the 5 ASIN updates. Can you please confirm the plan for each ASIN?
> e.g.,
> B0CLWSGD3V = $15 / 6GB
> B0CLX2QN4O = $18 / 9GB
> ..."**

Once we have this mapping, we can begin the surgical updates.

**The Surgical Workflow (To be repeated for each of the 5 ASINs):**

**1. Navigate to the Listing:**
*   Go to `Seller Central > Inventory > Manage All Inventory`.
*   Search for the first ASIN from our list (e.g., `B0CLWSGD3V`).
*   Click the **"Edit"** button for that product.

**2. Correct the Product Title:**
*   On the "Edit Product" page, find the tab for product identity (usually called "Vital Info" or "Product Identity").
*   Locate the **"Product Name"** field (this is the title).
*   Carefully edit the title to reflect the correct price and data amount based on the mapping from Xavi. (e.g., change "...$10 4GB Data..." to "...**$15 Monthly Plan ... 6 GB Data**...").
*   Ensure the entire title is grammatically correct and makes sense.

**3. Correct the Bullet Points:**
*   Go to the **"Description"** tab.
*   Find the **"Key Product Features"** section. These are your 5 bullet points.
*   Read through **every single bullet point.** Meticulously remove any mention of old data amounts, old prices, or incorrect plan details.
*   Rewrite the necessary parts to ensure they accurately reflect the new, correct plan details.

**4. Correct the A+ Content Text:**
*   This is a separate process. Navigate to `Advertising > A+ Content Manager`.
*   Find the A+ Content that is applied to the target ASIN. (You can search by ASIN).
*   Open the A+ Content editor.
*   Go through **every single text module** on the page. Scrutinize the text for any mention of incorrect plan details, prices, or data amounts.
*   Edit the text to be 100% accurate. **Do not touch the comparison table image itself yet.**

**5. Update the Tracker:**
*   Once you have completed all 4 steps above for one ASIN, go to our Google Sheet tracker.
*   Update the status for that ASIN's row: `Title Status` -> `Complete`, `Bullet Points Status` -> `Complete`, `A+ Text Status` -> `Complete`.

**Repeat this entire 5-step process for all 5 ASINs.**

This is our executable plan for Phase 1. It's methodical, precise, and leaves no room for error. Once we get that initial mapping from Xavi, we are cleared to engage. Let's do it.
