### **Operational Analysis & Discrepancy Report**

**Assigned Plan (Pending Confirmation):** **UNKNOWN. Listing is critically conflicted across multiple assets.**

**Discrepancy Summary:**

- **CRITICAL DATA CONFLICT:** The listing advertises **three different data plans** simultaneously.
  - **Title & Bullet #1 claim:** **3GB** of data.
  - **Hero Image claims:** **6GB** of data.
  - **A+ Content (Header & Comparison Table) claims:** **4GB** of data.
- **Price vs. Value Conflict:** The Buy Box price is **$10.00**, but the plan value is referenced as **$15.00**.
- **Misleading Language:** The bullet point "Unlimited Data... First 3GB at full speed..." is inherently confusing and contradicts all other information.

### **Action Plan & Directives**

**Directive 1 (Xavi):** Move the plan comparison table to the #1 position.
*   **STATUS:** **ON HOLD.** Moving the table would promote factually incorrect information (4GB).

**Directive 2 (Avi):** Simplify the comparison table design.
*   **STATUS:** **ON HOLD.** The table is one of three conflicting assets. A new design is needed, but only after the correct plan is identified.

**Recommended Path (Total Rebuild Required):**
- **[FLAG FOR REVIEW]** This ASIN must be completely rebuilt. It is unsalvageable in its current state.
- **[CLARIFY INTENT]** The first and most critical step is to ask Xavi/leadership: **"What plan is B0773WWM62 *supposed* to be? The page currently advertises 3GB, 4GB, and 6GB simultaneously."**
- **[AWAITING]** All work on this ASIN is on hold until its core identity is defined and the necessary hero image and A+ Content are created from scratch.
