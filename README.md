# Listing & Product Documentation

This repository serves as the central source of truth for all product information, listing details, and operational prompts for our brands, including **SecuLife** and **STK**.

The primary goal of this project is to maintain a consistent, accurate, and easily accessible library of information for all products to streamline listing management, customer support, and internal training.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by brand to ensure all related documentation is easy to locate. The structure is as follows:

*   `/seculife/`: Contains all documentation related to SecuLife products.
*   `/STK/`: Contains all documentation related to STK products.

Within each brand folder, you will find subdirectories for different types of information:

*   `listings/`: Contains detailed documentation for individual product listings. Files in this directory should be named by their unique **ASIN** (e.g., `B0FJYKP5SX.md`) to allow for quick and accurate searching.
*   `prompts/`: Contains standardized prompts, templates, and other operational documents (e.g., for customer experience, letters of authorization).

## How to Use This Repository

To find information for a specific product, navigate to the brand's folder and then into the `listings/` directory.

The most efficient way to find a product's documentation is to **use the GitHub search bar at the top of the page and search for the product's ASIN.**

## Contributing

When adding or updating a product file, please use the established templates to maintain consistency across all documentation. Ensure that all information is verified and accurate before committing changes to the `main` branch.
